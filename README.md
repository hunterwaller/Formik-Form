# Formik Form

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This is a simple form input using Formik as a validator.  It makes sure that both fields are filled and that the email field has a viable email.  It will also make sure both inputs are correct before allowing the user to 'sign-in'</p>

<h1>How to Run</h1>
<p>Once the files are installed, I believe you will have to run npm install inside the folder to get the correct dependencies.</p>

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>In the future, I will make a friendlier user interface.  Including a background, different fonts, and more inputs.</p>
